A Security operations tool to investigate and provide all information required to kill the phisher, removing their mailbox and domain.

Four distinct stages:
* CLI tool for security engineers (Most private)
* REST API service great for bulk reports and automation.
* Forwarding mail similar to what NCSC operates but as opposed to the black box approach they have it returns a fully formatted report.
* End goal killermail.io (Â£39.99 per year). Most accessible, widest reach.

Key Partners APIs:
* URLscan.io
* stat.ripe.net
